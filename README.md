# BlenderCaddie
CAD Tools for Blender

We want to make precision models for 3D printing replacement parts and components. Think: hinges, remote control covers, broken headphone pieces, things like that.

For development list, see: https://github.com/neuralfirings/BlenderCaddie/issues

We want to gather some info first on what features people would find useful and understand how users designs first. So everything in the issues list is currently an "idea."
