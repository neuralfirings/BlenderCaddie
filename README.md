We want to make precision models for 3D printing replacement parts and components. Think: hinges, remote control covers, broken headphone pieces, things like that.

## Instructions 
### [WARNING] this is a buggy pre-first version code
So far, all the tool does is enable you to set the length of one or more selected edges. I made this one so I can have a quick demo for how to create an add on. It needs a lot of clean up. But hey, come help clean up! Report bugs, add ideas for features using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/neuralfirings/BlenderCaddie/issues)!!

### How to install
1. Download [zip file here](https://github.com/neuralfirings/BlenderCaddie/raw/master/src/object_cad_utils.zip)
2. Open Blender
3. In Blender, go to File > User Preference > Add On > Install From File > Select the zip file you just downloaded
4. Search for "Blender Caddie" in the side bar (still in User Preference)
5. Click the check box next to Blender Caddie

### How to use
1. Click on one or more edge of a mesh in edit mode
2. Click on "CAD Tools" Tab in the Tool Shelf (left panel in the 3D viewer viewport)
3. Click "Set Edge Length"
4. Set Edge Length in the bottom part of the panel, you can also set whether you want to extend/shorten the edge both ways or only to one side
